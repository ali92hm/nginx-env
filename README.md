# Nginx Env Printer

Simple nginx container that shows all of the containers' env variables on the html page. This is purly for debugging and learning purposes and should not be used in production.

In addition to printing all env variables on the HTML page using the printenv command, `APP_NAME` and `APP_VERSION` env variables are shown on top of the page.

> Note: This is just for playing around and debugging, do not use it on a machine that can give away your env variables
